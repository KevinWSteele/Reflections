What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repository, it can convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository

You need to do it so you have the necessary files to start saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. 
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.

The staging area allows you to separate files so you can logically separate files when you commit them.
